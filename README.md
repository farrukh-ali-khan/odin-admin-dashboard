# Admin Dashboard

This project is part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS course. In this project, we will be building a fully responsive and functional admin dashboard layout using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **CSS Grid** for the majority of the layout work.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a clean and responsive admin dashboard layout. The dashboard will consist of several key sections:

- **Sidebar**: Contains the navigation and branding.
- **Header**: Contains the search bar, user info, and action buttons.
- **Main Content**: Displays content such as projects, announcements, and trending items.

The layout will be primarily built using CSS Grid with nested grid containers for better organization and flexibility.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the dashboard layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the dashboard and making it visually appealing.
- **CSS Grid**: For creating a flexible and organized layout.
